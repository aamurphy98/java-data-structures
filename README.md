# Java Data Structures

This repository is a work-in-progress collection of common data structures. The purpose of this repository is to revist software engineering fundamentals and build a foundation to address more complex problems and challenges.

In addition to implementing base operations for each data structure, I aim to provide a robust set of unit tests to verify correct behavior while continuing to build beyond basic data structure operations. The other goal of this project is to provide additional practice in documenting code as it is implemented to improve its long term readability and maintainability.

The currently implemented data structures are as follows:
* ArrayList
* LinkedList
* Queue
* Stack
* Binary Search Tree
